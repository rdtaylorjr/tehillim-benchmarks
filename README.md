# tehillim-benchmarks

## Overview

This repository evaluates representations of Biblical Hebrew against two fixed Psalms annotations and a related trajectory analysis. It scores half-verse representations for their capacity to rank annotated parallel relationships, scores psalm representations for their capacity to separate a supplied genre classification, and tests whether ordered within-psalm representation profiles covary with that classification. It is the evaluation layer of the Tehillim project. Representation construction is in [tehillim-embeddings](https://github.com/rdtaylorjr/tehillim-embeddings) and generated outputs are in [tehillim-data](https://github.com/rdtaylorjr/tehillim-data).

## Data

The parallelism benchmark reads `parallel_*` Text-Fabric features released by [tehillim-logos](https://github.com/rdtaylorjr/tehillim-logos) on ETCBC BHSA `half_verse` nodes. The features encode aligned group membership, type, signature, member span, and an ambiguity flag. They derive from Logos Bible Software's *Psalms Explorer Dataset*, used with permission. A separate runtime CSV assigns one of seven source genres to each of the 150 psalms. Neither licensed annotation source is committed here.

The repository reads dense and sparse Parquet vectors keyed by BHSA node identifier from `tehillim-embeddings`. It writes CSV, Parquet, and JSON outputs to `tehillim-data` under `benchmark={parallelism,genre,trajectory}/domain={...}/stage={...}`. This division keeps code, source annotation, representations, and derived results independently inspectable.

The data are operational annotations rather than neutral descriptions of poetic form. Logos supplies neither an annotation protocol nor adjudication history nor inter-annotator reliability estimate. BHSA `half_verse` boundaries and its morphosyntactic features also embody ETCBC analytic decisions. The benchmark preserves these choices as data conditions and reports their consequences without treating them as settled linguistic categories.

## Methodology

The loader reconstructs each annotation group from the `parallel_*` features. It converts a group signature into member-slot relations, preserving adjacent relations within a segment and matching reordered letters in a chiasm. A relation is excluded when a member is unresolved, marked ambiguous, or resolves to the same half-verse as its counterpart. Single-member segments produce no within-segment relation under this rule. This converts a literary annotation into a finite set of reproducible retrieval observations while keeping the omitted cases identifiable.

Average Precision is the primary outcome. Cosine similarity ranks annotated relations against adjacent, within-psalm half-verse pairs excluding nodes in surviving retrieval pairs. This local control retains generic adjacency and topical continuity. It does not create an unannotated nonparallel background because the source annotation covers most nodes. AUC, rank-based retrieval measures, similarity calibration against unmarked background nodes, and type-specific summaries remain secondary descriptions. Average Precision is reported with its positive-class prevalence because its scale depends on the true-to-control ratio.

Confidence intervals use a psalm-clustered BCa bootstrap. Resampling whole psalms retains the dependence among relations drawn from the same poem. Genre confidence intervals use a vertex bootstrap that resamples psalms and reconstructs their derived pair population. The code applies Benjamini-Hochberg and Benjamini-Yekutieli adjustments within defined metric, source, and scope families. Per-genre permutation tests shuffle psalm labels and use a joint maxT null across genres. These procedures test evidence against the stated labels. They do not decide whether a representation has captured parallelism or genre as literary phenomena.

For genre discrimination, each psalm vector is the mean of its available half-verse vectors. The evaluator scores all 11,175 unordered psalm pairs, labeling a pair positive when both psalms share the supplied source genre. It reports pooled and one-versus-rest Average Precision and AUC. The unequal class sizes make pooled outcomes largely responsive to prevalent genres, so genre-specific results remain necessary.

Trajectory analysis retains half-verse order. It derives a psalm centroid, an ordered cosine self-similarity matrix, adjacent similarity, step magnitude, and turning angle. Structural profiles are compared after length-normalized resampling or dynamic-time-warping alignment. Permutation tests compare within- and between-genre distances before and after residualizing distance on length difference, then on length difference and content distance. These controls identify whether an association persists under those specified nuisance models. They do not supply a theory-free separation of form from meaning.

## Results

The current public interface payloads contain 148 parallelism variants and 222 genre variants, excluding order-shuffle draws. An earlier result-store summary reported 222 parallelism and 220 genre variants. The repository has no release manifest that reconciles those output versions. The following descriptive maxima identify variants in the public payloads.

| Domain | Parallelism maximum AP | Genre maximum AP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Semantic | `kalm_embedding_gemma3_12b_2511_cantillation`, 0.395 | `gemini_embedding_2_cantillation`, 0.400 |
| ETCBC syntax | `phrase_subphrase_rela_1gram`, 0.384 | `phrase_marginal_typ_function`, 0.357 |
| Morphology | `morph_prs_ps_sp_plus`, 0.383 | `morph_prs_ps_sp_plus`, 0.356 |
| Lexical | `homograph_log_count`, 0.344 | `word_consonantal_icf_position_mean_psalm`, 0.460 |

The semantic parallelism maximum is calculated from 1,110 annotated relations and 2,784 local control pairs, giving an AP prevalence of 0.285. The 2,292 source groups become this scored relation set through explicit losses: 790 groups produce no relation under the signature rule, while 2,292 of 3,450 generated candidate pairs resolve to one half-verse, 43 include an ambiguous member, and five lack a member. The local control includes an annotation-bearing node in 2,720 pairs. Only 64 adjacent bicola carry no `parallel_*` annotation. Genre outcomes use the 11,175 unordered psalm pairs. These maxima summarize different input families and class prevalences. They do not supply a common scale of linguistic adequacy or a model-selection rule.

The result store also records a recurring negative pattern: all 43 semantic variants place the supplied Hymn class below AUC 0.5, with a mean AUC of 0.385 and a maximum of 0.469. This outcome warrants inspection of the source labels, the class composition, psalm length, and representation behavior. It does not establish that hymns lack a coherent literary profile.

## Limitations

Parallelism and genre scores quantify agreement with one commercial annotation resource. Source agreement does not validate a reference account of Hebrew poetry. A single genre per psalm suppresses mixed forms, diachronic relations, and the possibility that source categories overlap. The treatment of Psalms 57, 60, and 108 illustrates this constraint because Psalm 108 combines material from texts assigned another source category.

The adjacent control excludes scored retrieval pairs, yet it cannot match every source of lexical, grammatical, topical, or positional dependence. It also cannot establish a contrast with nonparallel text because only 64 adjacent bicola lack the source annotation. Scores are pooled across BHSA text types. Since text type is a syntactic analysis that can covary with the supplied genre labels, a pooled genre result cannot distinguish genre association from text-type composition. Representation choices and reported maxima use the same annotations and corpus. They are exploratory comparisons, without a held-out psalm partition or a null that reassigns annotation groups under within-psalm constraints. Psalm-level resampling addresses clustering at that level while leaving dependence within annotation groups and between textual relatives. Trajectory residualization depends on linear nuisance models and observable covariates. Remote embedding services and evolving model checkpoints can also change an input representation without changing this code.

A future confirmatory pass should fix representation choices on a predetermined psalm partition, evaluate them on a separate partition, stratify or condition on text type, and compare observed scores with within-psalm annotation reassignments that preserve documented group conditions. These procedures can test a stated representation claim. They cannot resolve the source taxonomy or interpret a poem.

## Reproducibility

Python 3.10 or later and the dependencies in `pyproject.toml` are required. The BHSA checkout is pinned to `v1.8.1` and the Logos Text-Fabric module to `v1.0`. Unit tests run without licensed annotations or vector files. Integration runs require permitted access to the Logos features, the source genre CSV, a local embeddings checkout, and a writable data checkout. The scripts accept model names, input paths, seeds, control settings, and output partitions. The emitted public payloads do not yet carry a complete manifest of those inputs or a source-code revision. The result-version discrepancy above shows why a release manifest is necessary. Byte-identical reproduction depends on access to the same external annotation and model artifacts.
